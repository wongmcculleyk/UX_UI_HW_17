            <p>Known as the “techie” person in my years as a teacher of English language learners at all grade levels, I finally decided to take my experience in instructional design and teaching into the world of UX/UI design. 

            My bachelor’s degree is in English Language and Composition, and I learned UX/UI design through the Northwestern UX/UI Bootcamp. Teaching has allowed me to hone my presentation skills and develop a user-centered design mindset. I may not always get it right the first time, but I am happy to learn from mistakes and receive feedback from others. There is always more to learn.
            
            In my free time I cook, bake, and blog about cooking and baking. I may even have created a few recipe TikToks. When I can find time I also create and construct quilts for myself and my family (but mostly for myself).
